        Initializes the Pose2TextTranslationProcessor for converting sequences of body poses into text inputs
        for multimodal sequence-to-sequence models.

        Args:
            tokenizer (Optional[Any], optional): A tokenizer object used to tokenize the text output.
                Usually loaded via Hugging Face's AutoTokenizer.
            reduce_holistic_poses (bool, optional): If True, reduces the dimensionality of holistic pose representations.
                This can help simplify the input by selecting a subset of keypoints. See more at:
                https://github.com/sign-language-processing/pose. Defaults to True.
            skip_frames_stride (Optional[int], optional):  If set, skips input frames at the given stride.
                Useful for downsampling frame sequences during preprocessing.

        Returns a transformation function applied at the dataset level during iteration.

        This method defines a transformation that is applied to each batch **within the dataset iterator**, 
        typically by using `datasets.Dataset.with_transform()`. As a result, the transformation is executed 
        at runtime during `__getitem__()` or `__getitems__()`, which allows it to benefit from prefetching 
        and parallel data loading when using multiple DataLoader workers.

        Unlike the `_obtain_*` methods, which are also executed on-the-fly but within the **processor call 
        (typically inside the DataCollator)**, this transformation occurs **prior to batching and collation**. 
        It is therefore ideal for operations that are expensive and can be parallelized at the sample or batch 
        level, such as decoding signals, loading external files, or converting inputs to intermediate formats.

        Use this method to preprocess inputs early in the pipeline while maintaining a modular design that 
        separates dataset-level and collator-level responsibilities.

        Args:
            batch (Dict[str, List[Any]]): A dictionary representing a batch of dataset examples (not yet collated).

            Dict[str, List[Any]]: The transformed batch, with updated or added fields ready for collation.
